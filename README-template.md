## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I didn't learned much in this project, i have already done most of the things here before so I just remembered some topics that I have touched before. 

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on animations, sometimes these challenges got some menus and that stuff, so I always try to add an animation to make it look better :)
